# Version 1.0 Early Development. A plugin for Piwigo that requires users to have a code for registration. Codes can be set to expire or to a defined number of uses.
# It's my first Piwigo plugin, so trying to keep it simple for everyone to learn from.
# Does not keep codes between activations
# to do: failing a registration (email/user in use, etc) can count towards uses of a code even though unsuccessful over-all. Need to find way to trigger on success to only count at that time.
# foundation-datepicker used from https://github.com/najlepsiwebdesigner/foundation-datepicker
