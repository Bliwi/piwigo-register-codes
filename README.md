# Early Development
# It's my first Piwigo plugin, so trying to keep it simple for everyone to learn from.
# Does not keep codes between activations
# to do: failing a registration (email/user in use, etc) can count towards uses of a code, should probably only count if successful
# to do: clicking add / delete on admin configuration doesn't refresh correctly to show new changes
# foundation-datepicker used from https://github.com/najlepsiwebdesigner/foundation-datepicker
