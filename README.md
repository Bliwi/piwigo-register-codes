# Version 1.4 Early Release. A plugin for Piwigo that requires users to have a code for registration. Codes can be set to expire or to a defined number of uses.
# Major Fixes:
    Added history logging and session based counting.
# Notes:
    Does not keep codes between activations (can alter design)
# to do:
    Translations, trying to build with it in mind but currently have no translations.
# Shout Outs:
    foundation-datepicker used from https://github.com/najlepsiwebdesigner/foundation-datepicker
    Version 1.25+ includes huge contributions from Bliwi who added code generate/copy buttons, a batch code generator and plenty of visual improvements and testing, thanks!
